\begin{letter}{Hiring Manager \\ Splunk Inc. \\ 270 Brannan Street \\ San Francisco, CA 94107}

\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the Software Developer Intern position at Splunk. As a current Master's student in Software Engineering at Arizona State University, with extensive hands-on experience in developing cloud-based platforms, front-end technologies, and scalable infrastructure, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Splunk’s mission of building a safer and more resilient digital world.

In my most recent role as a Software Developer at Western Union, I worked on migrating legacy applications to modern architectures and implemented a Test-Driven Development (TDD) strategy. This experience honed my skills in writing clean, testable code and collaborating with cross-functional teams, which aligns with Splunk’s focus on innovative software solutions. My technical background includes proficiency in languages such as Python, JavaScript, and Go, as well as experience with Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud platforms like AWS and GCP.

In addition to my technical expertise, I have successfully led projects that required complex problem-solving and coordination. For instance, I developed an Online Compiler Web IDE that allowed over 50 students to perform computation-heavy tasks on a cloud-based platform, which saved time and resources for educational institutions. This project’s use of Docker and Kubernetes to optimize the environment aligns with Splunk's emphasis on infrastructure resilience.

Splunk’s culture of fostering creativity and collaboration, along with its cutting-edge work in machine learning, data analytics, and infrastructure automation, deeply resonates with my own professional goals. I am excited to bring my passion for software development, problem-solving skills, and a commitment to excellence to the Splunk team.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to further discuss how my background and experiences align with Splunk’s vision and the contributions I can make as a Software Developer Intern. I look forward to the opportunity to speak with you.

\closing{Sincerely,\\ Ashutosh Kumbhar}
