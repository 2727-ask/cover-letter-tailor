Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the \textbf{Software Development Internship, SDA (Summer 2025)} at \textbf{Cadence}. As a \textbf{Master’s student in Software Engineering at Arizona State University} with a strong foundation in \textbf{software development, system design, and performance optimization}, I am eager to contribute my technical expertise to your esteemed organization.

During my tenure as a \textbf{Software Developer at Western Union}, I developed and maintained critical components of the \textbf{POS retail application}, ensuring seamless functionality and optimal performance. I spearheaded the creation of a \textbf{Point of Sale Development Utility}, which improved developer efficiency by \textbf{70\%}, and played a key role in migrating \textbf{WUPOS from Apache Tapestry to Angular 14}, leading to a \textbf{15\% revenue increase and enhanced user experience}. My proficiency in \textbf{C++, JavaScript, and Python}, along with my expertise in \textbf{graphics rendering (2D/3D), cloud computing, and test-driven development}, aligns well with the role's technical requirements.

Beyond my professional experience, I have led and contributed to innovative projects, including an \textbf{Online Compiler Web IDE} supporting over \textbf{10+ programming languages} using \textbf{Docker, Kubernetes, and Redis}. I also developed a \textbf{hospital resource management system} using \textbf{Vue.js and Electron.js}, improving efficiency in real-time data visualization. These projects reflect my ability to solve complex challenges through scalable and high-performance software solutions.

\textbf{Cadence’s mission to innovate in EDA and software development strongly resonates with me}. I am particularly excited about the opportunity to \textbf{learn Cadence’s software development processes, prototype solutions, and integrate them into cutting-edge products}. My passion for \textbf{technology, problem-solving, and continuous learning} makes me a strong fit for this internship.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences can contribute to \textbf{Cadence’s continued success}. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely, \\
Ashutosh Kumbhar
